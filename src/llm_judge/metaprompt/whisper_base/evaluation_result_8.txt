Format each score as (X/5).\n   - Calculate the total score out of 15 points and format it as (X/15).\n\n3. **Objectivity:**\n   - Ensure the comparison is unbiased.\n   - Clearly identify and highlight the strengths of each transcript.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\n- **Transcript A:**\n  - Readability: (X/5)\n  - Level of Detail: (X/5)\n  - Conciseness: (X/5)\n  - **Total Score:** (X/15)\n\n- **Transcript B:**\n  - Readability: (X/5)\n  - Level of Detail: (X/5)\n  - Conciseness: (X/5)\n  - **Total Score:** (X/15)\n\n**Example:**\n\n- **Transcript A:**\n  - Readability: (4/5)\n  - Level of Detail: (3/5)\n  - Conciseness: (5/5)\n  - **Total Score:** (12/15)\n\n- **Transcript B:**\n  - Readability: (3/5)\n  - Level of Detail: (4/5)\n  - Conciseness: (4/5)\n  - **Total Score:** (11/15)\n\n---\n\nThis prompt ensures a structured, unbiased comparison and clearly highlights the strengths of each transcript.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None), 'evaluation': ChatCompletionMessage(content='### Evaluation of Transcripts\n\n- **Transcript A:**\n  - Readability: (4/5)  \n    The language is clear, but the military jargon may be challenging for non-specialists. Still, the structure of information is logical and coherent.\n  \n  - Level of Detail: (4/5)  \n    Provides important operational details regarding flights, enemy movements, and engagement rules. However, it may lack context for those not familiar with military operations.\n\n  - Conciseness: (4/5)  \n    The message is relatively concise, delivering critical information without unnecessary elaboration. There is a slight redundancy in numeral references (e.g., "two-five-zero" and "10-zero") which could have been streamlined.\n\n  - **Total Score:** (12/15)\n\n- **Transcript B:**\n  - Readability: (4/5)  \n    Similar to Transcript A, the readability is good, though military terminology might still present a barrier to understanding for an untrained audience. The formatting of numerical references is slightly different from Transcript A.\n\n  - Level of Detail: (4/5)  \n    Contains the necessary details about flight regulation and enemy movement. However, like Transcript A, it may leave out additional context or implications for a broader audience.\n\n  - Conciseness: (5/5)  \n    Very concise, effectively delivering essential information without surplus wording. Uses shorthand effectively, except the numerals’ representation ("10-0") is less clear than in Transcript A.\n\n  - **Total Score:** (13/15)\n\n### Overall Comparison\n- **Better Overall:** Transcript B  \nWhile both transcripts provide essential information, Transcript B scores slightly higher overall due to its improved conciseness, while maintaining readability and level of detail comparable to Transcript A. \n\n---\n### Summary\n- **Transcript A: Total Score: (12/15)**\n- **Transcript B: Total Score: (13/15)**\n\n**Conclusion:** Transcript B is the better overall choice due to its efficient communication style while maintaining clarity and detail.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)}
