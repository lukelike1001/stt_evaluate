Format each rating as (Score/5).\n- After rating all criteria, provide the total score for each transcript out of 15 points (Total: X/15).\n- Ensure the comparison is unbiased and clearly identifies the strengths of each transcript.\n\n**Example Format:**\n- **Readability:**  \n  Transcript A: 4/5  \n  Transcript B: 3/5\n- **Level of Detail:**  \n  Transcript A: 5/5  \n  Transcript B: 4/5\n- **Conciseness:**  \n  Transcript A: 3/5  \n  Transcript B: 5/5\n- **Total Score:**  \n  Transcript A: 12/15  \n  Transcript B: 12/15\n\n**Provide your evaluation below:**\n---', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None), 'evaluation': ChatCompletionMessage(content='**Evaluation of Transcripts:**\n\n- **Readability:**  \n  Transcript A: 5/5  \n  Transcript B: 4/5  \n\n  *Analysis:* Transcript A uses correct terminology (RPA Overwatch instead of RPA overwatch) which may enhance clarity for the intended audience familiar with military terminology. The capitalization is consistently applied, creating a clearer understanding. Transcript B has inconsistent capitalization ("flop markers" instead of "FLOT markers") which may confuse readers less familiar with the terms.\n\n- **Level of Detail:**  \n  Transcript A: 5/5  \n  Transcript B: 5/5  \n\n  *Analysis:* Both transcripts provide the same amount of detail regarding the mission strategy and technology being referenced. There are no omissions in the content, and both transcripts provide equal context and specificity.\n\n- **Conciseness:**  \n  Transcript A: 5/5  \n  Transcript B: 5/5  \n\n  *Analysis:* Both transcripts convey the information without any unnecessary verbosity. They are concise and deliver essential information clearly and effectively.\n\n- **Total Score:**  \n  Transcript A: 15/15  \n  Transcript B: 14/15  \n\n**Overall Verdict:** Transcript A is the better option primarily due to its superior readability. Its attention to detail in capitalization enhances clarity without sacrificing content or conciseness. While both transcripts have the same level of detail and conciseness, Transcript B\'s minor errors slightly detract from its overall quality.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)}
