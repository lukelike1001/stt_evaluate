{'meta_refinement': ChatCompletionMessage(content='**Improved Evaluation Prompt for GPT-4o-Mini:**\n\nCompare the two provided transcripts based on the following criteria:\n\n1. **Readability**\n2. **Level of Detail**\n3. **Conciseness**\n\nFor each criterion, assign a rating using a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (e.g., Readability: 4/5). Then, calculate the total score out of 15 for each transcript (e.g., Total: 12/15).\n\nEnsure the comparison is unbiased and clearly highlight the strengths of each transcript.\n\n**Example Format:**\n\n**Transcript A:**\n- Readability: X/5\n- Level of Detail: X/5\n- Conciseness: X/5\n- **Total: X/15**\n\n**Transcript B:**\n- Readability: X/5\n- Level of Detail: X/5\n- Conciseness: X/5\n- **Total: X/15**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- *Transcript A:* [List strengths]\n- *Transcript B:* [List strengths]', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None), 'evaluation': ChatCompletionMessage(content='**Transcript A:**\n- Readability: 4/5  \n  *Strengths include a clear flow of information, appropriate use of military acronyms, and relatively simple sentence structures that enhance understanding. However, the presence of a special character (â€”) might be distracting.*\n\n- Level of Detail: 5/5  \n  *This transcript contains all necessary details regarding the situation and actions required, such as the identification of hostile troops, the submission of a 9-line CAS request, and the condition for proceeding under the ROE.*\n\n- Conciseness: 4/5  \n  *The transcript is mostly concise and delivers information without unnecessary elaboration. There could be slight improvements in sentence condensation but overall it remains efficient.*\n\n- **Total: 13/15**\n\n**Transcript B:**\n- Readability: 3/5  \n  *Overall readability is hindered by typographical errors (e.g., "cash" instead of "CAS" and "flat" instead of "FLOT") that could confuse the reader. The flow is slightly less effective due to the inconsistencies.*\n\n- Level of Detail: 5/5  \n  *All essential information is presented, mirroring the clarity and detail of Transcript A; the necessary actions and specifics regarding the situation are clearly outlined.*\n\n- Conciseness: 4/5  \n  *Like Transcript A, it is concise, although the misuse of terms reduces precision slightly without adding value to the content.*\n\n- **Total: 12/15**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- *Transcript A:* \n  - Strong readability due to clearer syntax and appropriate language.\n  - Comprehensive detail without missing any critical information.\n  - Effective use of military terminology that is likely familiar to intended audiences.\n\n- *Transcript B:* \n  - Maintains an equal level of detail, providing all necessary information for tactical operations.\n  - Concisely presents information with a similar structure to Transcript A.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\nTranscript A is better overall due to its superior readability and clear communication. Although both transcripts convey the necessary information and share the same level of detail, Transcript A\'s clarity and avoidance of typographical errors contribute to a more effective communication of the message.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)}
