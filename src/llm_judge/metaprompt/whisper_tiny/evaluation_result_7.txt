{'meta_refinement': ChatCompletionMessage(content='**Refined Evaluation Prompt for Transcript Comparison**\n\n---\n\n**Task:** Compare two transcripts based on Readability, Level of Detail, and Conciseness.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Criteria Evaluation:**\n   - **Readability:** Rate each transcript from 1 to 5 (1 = very difficult to read, 5 = very easy to read).\n   - **Level of Detail:** Rate each transcript from 1 to 5 (1 = lacks necessary details, 5 = thoroughly detailed).\n   - **Conciseness:** Rate each transcript from 1 to 5 (1 = overly wordy, 5 = highly concise).\n\n2. **Scoring:**\n   - Provide individual scores for each criterion (e.g., Readability: Transcript A - 4/5, Transcript B - 3/5).\n   - Calculate and display the total score out of 15 for each transcript (e.g., Transcript A: 13/15, Transcript B: 10/15).\n\n3. **Unbiased Comparison:**\n   - Ensure evaluations are impartial.\n   - Highlight the strengths of each transcript in each category.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n- **Readability:**\n  - Transcript A: 4/5\n  - Transcript B: 3/5\n\n- **Level of Detail:**\n  - Transcript A: 5/5\n  - Transcript B: 4/5\n\n- **Conciseness:**\n  - Transcript A: 4/5\n  - Transcript B: 3/5\n\n- **Total Score:**\n  - Transcript A: 13/15\n  - Transcript B: 10/15\n\n**Objective:** Provide a clear, unbiased comparison that identifies and explains the strengths of each transcript in the specified categories.\n\n---\n\nThis prompt is concise and structured to guide GPT-4o-mini effectively through the evaluation process, ensuring clarity and impartiality in the comparison.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None), 'evaluation': ChatCompletionMessage(content='## Evaluation of Transcripts\n\n### Readability:\n- **Transcript A:** 4/5\n  - **Strengths:** The text flows well and is easy to follow. Technical terms are relatively clear in context.\n- **Transcript B:** 3/5\n  - **Strengths:** Overall readable, but the spelling of “IADS” (as “I-A-D-S”) may disrupt the natural flow for some readers.\n\n### Level of Detail:\n- **Transcript A:** 5/5\n  - **Strengths:** Contains all necessary details regarding the route, systems checked, and precautions taken. The information provides a comprehensive understanding of the situation.\n- **Transcript B:** 4/5\n  - **Strengths:** Similarly detailed but slightly less effective due to minor variations in wording, such as “Flop” instead of “FLOT,” which may cause confusion.\n\n### Conciseness:\n- **Transcript A:** 4/5\n  - **Strengths:** Effectively conveys the message without unnecessary words or embellishment, making it concise and to the point.\n- **Transcript B:** 3/5\n  - **Strengths:** Still concise, but the additional spelling out of “IADS” might be seen as slightly verbose or disruptive.\n\n### Total Score:\n- **Transcript A:** 13/15\n- **Transcript B:** 10/15\n\n### Conclusion:\nOverall, **Transcript A** is better due to its superior readability, detail, and conciseness. It maintains flow and clarity while providing comprehensive information effectively. While Transcript B retains some good qualities, the variations in spelling and terminology detract from its overall effectiveness.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)}
