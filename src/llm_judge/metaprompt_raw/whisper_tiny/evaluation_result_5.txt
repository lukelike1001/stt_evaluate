This makes it easier for the reader to identify direct quotes and understand the context.\n- **Weaknesses:** None noted.\n\n**Transcript B:**\n- **Strengths:** The lack of quotation marks may give it a more conversational style to some readers, making it seem like a flowing narrative.\n- **Weaknesses:** The absence of quotation marks makes it challenging to differentiate between the manager\'s words and the narrator\'s commentary. This can lead to confusion, especially for readers trying to grasp the original statements made.\n\n**Verdict on Readability:** **Transcript A** is superior due to better use of formatting for clarity.\n\n#### Level of Detail\n**Transcript A:**\n- **Strengths:** Provides a clear account of the manager’s statements with direct quotations that convey precise meanings.
