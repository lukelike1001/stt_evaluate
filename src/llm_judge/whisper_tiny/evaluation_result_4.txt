The phrasing around the “bare rock” has an interesting play with words, which may cause a minor pause for understanding but ultimately does not detract from readability. The use of the dash (â€”) is incorrect; it likely should be an em dash (—) for improved readability. Overall, it remains fairly easy to read. \n  - **Score: 4**\n\n- **Transcript B**: Similar to Transcript A, it begins with the catchy phrase. However, the line "I saw a bear rock near the stream" introduces a potential grammatical ambiguity due to the incorrect phrase "bear rock."

The phrasing here is clearer than in Transcript A despite the grammatical error, but the construction can lead to some confusion. \n  - **Score: 3**\n\n### 2.
