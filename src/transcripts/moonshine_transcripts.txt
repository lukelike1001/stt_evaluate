Maintain fl-250-250 and rtb by 1930 Zulu. Isr confirms 10-0 enemy movement at grid 43n73e. Engage only with pid and confirm bda within 2-4-hour cycles. Ato specifies 4 cs sorties for 1200 Zulu, not 1400.
Colonel Maddox briefed on op thunderstrike, highlighting the EHC J-Stars tracking MTI's near OBJ Falcon. Captain Hargrove noted terrain masking south of Mount Hesper may interfere with JTAC comms. Recalibrate IFF and Taycan if comms degrade.
